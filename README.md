# Realworld-Slices

A Realworld.io backend following SOLID architecture in slices, not layers.

https://github.com/jonathonflorek/realworld-slices

This implementation is inspired by the talk "SOLID Architecture in Slices not Layers" by Jimmy Bogard, the tech lead of the project that coined the term "onion architecture". See this talk [here](https://vimeo.com/131633177).

[This](https://github.com/jbogard/ContosoUniversityDotNetCore) project by the same person also inspires the file layout of this project.

[This](https://github.com/nt-ca-aqe/blog-microservices-testing-nodejs-typescript/blob/master/package.json) project is also used as a basis for testing.
