# Realworld-Slices

A Realworld.io backend following SOLID architecture in slices, not layers.

This implementation is inspired by the talk "SOLID Architecture in Slices not Layers" by Jimmy Bogard, the tech lead of the project that coined the term "onion architecture". See this talk [here](https://vimeo.com/131633177).

[This](https://github.com/jbogard/ContosoUniversityDotNetCore) project by the same person also inspires the file layout of this project.
